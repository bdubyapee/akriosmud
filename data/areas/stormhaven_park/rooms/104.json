    "description": "This path looks to be well used by a number of pedestrians from the city.\nHard packed dirt runs northwest and south here, wide enough to let several\npeople walk beside each other. Along the trail tall, ancient trees stand\nlike guards at attention to either side. Their branches criss crossing each\nother making a conopy above the trail. A variety of bushes and grasses grow\nbetween the silent senteries.",
