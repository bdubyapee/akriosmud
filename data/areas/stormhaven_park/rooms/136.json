    "description": "Below this bridge crystal clear water rests calmly, with only the occasional\nripple disturbing the surface of the pond. The bridge itself is made of\nfinely sanded wood stained a dark red, and is wide enough to let a few\npeople stand side by side. Handrails made of the same red stained wood run\non either side of the bridge, offering support and safety for those\ncrossing. To the west is a small island upon which several stone benches\nsit. To the east a dirt path leads off into the trees.",
