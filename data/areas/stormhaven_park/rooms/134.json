    "description": "The tiny, overgrown trail suddenly empties out into a clearing that stands\nbefore a cave. Tall grass and bushes surround a semicircle of solid rock on\nthe ground. The cave appears to be nothing more than a large rock sitting\natop another with a gap between the two. Enormous trees loom over the\nclearing and cave as if trying to hide it from the outside world.",
