Criss crossed with sparkling mineral veins, the wall stands at\nleast twenty feet tall. To the west is a large stone building, sounds of\nmerriment floating out of the windows. Above the door to the building is a\nsign, \"William the Braves Tavern\". East Wall Road continues on to the north\nand south.",
