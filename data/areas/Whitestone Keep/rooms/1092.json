    "description": " The entire west side of the room is occupied by a large four foot tall bar.\nThe west wall is lined with doorless shelves containing all manner of\nbottles and trinkets. The remaining floor space is covered with a variety of\ntables and chairs. No two tables appear to be the same, however the chairs\nall appear to be crafted the same. Many paintings line the walls along with\nhooks for hanging cloaks and other gear. Spaced evenly around each wall are\niron brackets, each holding a torch to light the room.",
