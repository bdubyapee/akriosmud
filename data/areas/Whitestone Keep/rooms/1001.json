    "description": "You are on a hard packed gravel path. To the west is the Eastern\nentrance to Whitestone Keep. Massive iron bound timbers are fastened\ntogether to form the forbidding doors to the inner city. The city walls\nthemselves are easily twenty feet tall. White granite blocks with veins of\nshimmering minerals, the massive wall runs both north and south from here.\nTo the west you can see the towering peaks of the Castle of Whitestone\nKeep reaching towards the sky.",
