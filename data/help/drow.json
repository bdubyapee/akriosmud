They make their\nhome underground in a labrinth of tunnels and catacombs known as The Black\nPits. They are a cunning race that excel at magic and stealth. They are dark\nskinned with white hair, and red or violet eyes. Drow and elves are mortal\nenemies and will not hesitate to kill one another on sight.",
