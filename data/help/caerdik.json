He can be quite thick headed and stubborn, and is\nquick to anger. He is though, usually quite fair and just, even if he is a\nbit emotional. He respects Aludra and Nephium, but is somewhat wary of\nSelucia because of her unpredictability. His mortal enemy is Sirian, and he\ndetests Myst who seems to flirt with him just because she knows it upsets\nhim. He also does not get along with Malyki, though he doesn't seem to know\nwhy. Most likely because they are two sides of the same coin. Caerdik's\nfollowers are usually those who enforce the law or at least believe in it.\nTheir spells usually consist of righteous attack and protective spells. They\nare usually very handy in a fight.",
