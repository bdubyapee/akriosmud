The city itself grew around the\nshrine. Before written history, an invading force of unknown origin\nlaid seige to Whitestone and a large portion of the city was sacked.\nThrough a miracle of intervention by Caerdik himself, the shrine and a\nsmall portion of the city itself were saved from destruction. Armies gathered\nfrom the various family dukies which arrived too late for the cities defense.\nThose armies were put to work on construction of an outer wall the likes of\nwhich had never been seen in Akrios. Working quaries for stone, hauling\nand placing stone. Many workers died in the years of construction. Upon it's\ncompletion 9 years later many workers remained in and near Whitestone Keep\nadding to it's size and strength.\n\nWhitestone Keep is ruled jointly by law between the King and Praetor of Caerdik.\nAlthough in recent years the high Praetor of Caerdik has given deference to the\nKing on all matters of the State. Likewise, the King has given deference to the\nPraetor in all matters of religion. The nobile families each hold swaths of land\nwhich in turn they behold to barons for military service of their men. The nobles\nthemselves mainly reside in Whitestone Keep. The priests generally stay out of\nmost things normally relegated to the secular side of rule. They do not patrol the\nstreets as the Kings militia does, nor do they hold court.\n\nPriests of Caerdik are held in high regard. Almost as nobility, much to the distress\nof the ruling nobles. Whether to keep the priests in line, or merely because they\nare curious the King has decreed all goodly races are allowed to enter Whitestone Keep, \neven the overtly feared magic wielders. The common folk hold no fear or distrust\nof the other goodly races though the religious order believes them to be inferior as\nCaerdik is the creator of Humankind and therefor the superior being. There is one\nsmall 'formal' mages guild, though they cater only to traditional magecraft.",
