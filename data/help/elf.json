The elves call this place home\nliving in the tops of the great trees. Elves are a magical race being bery\nattuned to the mystic arts. They are highly intelligent and agile and can\nnot be found in a forest unless they wish to be. Their society is based\naround nobility. Elves can be a hard people to understand as they are a\nmoody people and noone really understands what the elves find offensive and\nwhat they like. In fact most people think elves find all things offensive\nexcept other elves and magic. Elves and Mazreki are mortal enemies. The\nelves view the Mazreki as being abominations and would love nothing more\nthan to see the species wiped from the earth. Elves stand about 5'5\" to\n6'0\". They have gold, blue, green, or violet eyes. Their hair is either\nwhite, blonde, or a lightly hued blue. They are a wonderful source of\nmagical knowledge, if one can get them to talk with them.",
