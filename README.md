** This AkriosMUD Project has been replaced by https://github.com/bdubyapee/akrios-ii as well as the associated front end at https://github.com/bdubyapee/akrios-frontend.

The original version of this MUD resides at https://github.com/bdubyapee/apm

This was the working copy for a number of years.  The latest rendition has a dedicated front-end which allows Telnet/SSH client connections and communicates with the new game engine via websockets.  All utilizing asyncio.   The new game engine is being converted to asyncio.  A full updated readme will appear on both of those projects soon.
